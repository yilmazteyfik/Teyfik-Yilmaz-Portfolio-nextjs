description: The project is an iOS application that I developed using Swift 5 and UIKit. I cloned an application available on the App Store, implementing UIKit programmatically instead of using Storyboard for increased flexibility and customization. Additionally, I integrated external packages such as Alamofire and Kingfisher. The application retrieves data using Apple's APIs, providing users with similar functionality.
